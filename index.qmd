## Process Mining

Process mining is a data-driven approach to analyze and improve business processes based on event logs generated by information systems. It involves extracting knowledge from event logs to discover, monitor, and improve processes by identifying patterns, deviations, and inefficiencies.

### Example of Process Mining Use

Imagine a manufacturing company that wants to optimize its production line. By analyzing event logs from its manufacturing execution system (MES), the company can identify bottlenecks, delays, and deviations from the ideal process flow. Process mining reveals insights into production cycle times, resource utilization, and order fulfillment rates, enabling the company to make data-driven decisions to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

### Simulated Event Log

Let's simulate an event log for the "Order-to-Cash" process at TechTrend Solutions. We'll include activities such as "Receive Order," "Prepare Invoice," "Send Invoice," and "Receive Payment." In the simulated data, we'll introduce some unusual scenarios, such as skipped activities or out-of-sequence events, to represent deviations from the normative process.

| CaseID | Timestamp        | Activity        |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1      | 2024-05-12 08:00 | Receive Order   |
| 1      | 2024-05-12 10:00 | Prepare Invoice |
| 1      | 2024-05-13 09:00 | Send Invoice    |
| 1      | 2024-05-15 14:00 | Receive Payment |
| 2      | 2024-05-12 09:30 | Receive Order   |
| 2      | 2024-05-12 11:30 | Prepare Invoice |
| 2      | 2024-05-13 10:30 | Receive Payment |
| 3      | 2024-05-12 08:30 | Receive Order   |
| 3      | 2024-05-12 10:45 | Send Invoice    |
| 3      | 2024-05-13 11:30 | Receive Payment |

| 4      | 2024-05-12 12:00 | Prepare Invoice |
| 4      | 2024-05-13 10:00 | Send Invoice    |
| 4      | 2024-05-13 13:00 | Receive Payment |

### Process Mining Tool

We'll use Disco from Fluxicon to analyze the event log and discover the process model.

First, we created a dataset from above in Excel, and we saved it in .csv format to later import in Disco.

## Quarto Book

We created a Quarto book to document the process mining journey, including the explanation of process mining concepts, the simulated event log, screenshots of Disco analysis.

## Reflection

Working together with my team member on the assignment has been a fulfilling and enlightening adventure. We have gone through identifying challenges in defining some business processes, collecting process-related questions and data through the use of Excel and analyzing the processes by the work of software Disco we never used before. It is possible to summarize that collaboration enabled us to get a better understanding of how business processes operate and how crucial it is to manage them effectively to remain competitive in the market. Both of us had the opportunity to investigate and learn about such processes as human resources, payroll, acquisitions, marketing, and financial reporting. We discussed each activity, shared opinions, and got a comprehensive perspective due to engaging in knowledge sharing. Our collaboration allowed combining our prior knowledge and personal skills we managed to develop within the team functioning. The Quarto book creation was collaborative work based on combining two minds for a common goal, our combined data visualization, storytelling, and general organization of the content expertise. Even the Quarto book creation was very compelling in terms of interests since Quarto book and pushing a page online was new and quite exciting. Additionally, the team met certain challenges within the assignment activity, such as the challenging interpretation of process models work through software. However, our collaboration experience and teamwork approach concentrated on investing in research and to continue to support each other were essential to combat these challenges. Therefore, reflection on our assignment journey implies the importance of collaboration, cooperation, knowledge sharing, and continuing learning to meet expected goals in the future. It is likely that both of us will continue to mix both reflections and expertise to drive the future career and organizational goals.
